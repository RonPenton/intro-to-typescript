# Example 1 - Setup

This example shows you how to compile your very first TypeScript app.

Use the following commands to run the example:

* `npm init`
* `npm install typescript –g`
* `tsc –init`
* `npm install typescript –-save-dev`
* `code .`

Now create a file named `index.ts`, containing the following code:

```
const n = "TypeScript";
console.log("Hello, " + n + "!");
```

Execute the `tsc` command, and examine the output `index.js`.
